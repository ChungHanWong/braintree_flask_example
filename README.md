# Braintree Flask Example
An example Braintree integration for python in the Flask framework.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install packages
  `python setup.py install`

2. Copy the `application.cfg.sample` file to `application.cfg` and fill in your Braintree API credentials. Credentials can be found by navigating to Account > My user > View API Keys in the Braintree control panel. Full instructions can be [found on our support site](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-credentials).

3. Start server
  `python app.py`

## Running tests

Unit tests do not make api calls to Braintree and do not require Braintree credentials. You can run this project's unit tests by calling `python test_app.py` on the command line.

## Pro Tips

- The `application.cfg.example` contains an `APP_SECRET_KEY` setting. Even in development you should [generate your own custom secret key for your app](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#sessions).
